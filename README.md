-- The Something Blog --

- This website is a personal site of mine (Colin Strasser). The goal with this website is to include almost all markup and programming features that I learn about during my career as a software engineer.
As I learn new features and functionalities, I plan to create posts about them and my thoughts and experience with them.

Current goal: 
  Add HTML and CSS features such as animations and keyframes.
  Create add post button/function ~ create security function so that visitors of the site will not be able to add posts.
